A JAva Weightlifting Programmer

Given a weightlifting program as a set of cycles (e.g weeks) consisting
of workouts and rules for progression, apply these rules continuously
to generate a weightlifting program outline for N weeks, given initial
state (weight) values.

For example, take Candito's Linear Program as a program consisting of 1 cycle
with 4 workouts, with the rule of increasing by 0-10 lbs per exercise (aside:
how to account for variability?). Ajawp will take this as an input alongside
initial weights and output an outline program of values and progressions.

One can contrast this with 5/3/1 consisting of 4 cycles of 4 workouts.
